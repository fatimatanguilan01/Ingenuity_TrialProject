Welcome to the Employee Management Manual. Please follow the instructions below and should be done in order as described.
1. Open your SQL Developer. Once connected to the database, Run this script: SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
2. SET SERVEROUTPUT ON is used to display necessary message in the script output tab.
3. First thing to do is create this 2 tables: Open the text file CREATE_EMPLOYEES.txt, CREATE_DEPARTMENT.txt.
4. Copy and Paste the code to SQL Developer, then press F5 or highlight all the lines and Run the code for it to be compiled.
5. Before adding new employee information, it is pre-requisite to add Department details first.
6. Open the text file named PROCEDURE_ADD_DEPARTMENT.txt.
7. Copy and Paste the code to SQL Developer, then press F5 or highlight all the lines and Run the code for it to be compiled.
8. After you create/compile the procedure, you have to run the procedure by running it using below syntax,
   e.g. EXEC ADD_DEPARTMENT(100, 'MARKETING');
   Note: The value 100 is the UNIQUE Department Id, while the 'MARKETING' is the Department Name.
9. Insert all the needed department details in DEPARTMENT table.
10. Open the text file named CREATE_SEQUENCE_EMPID.txt, this sequence will generate unique Employee number during insertion of new employee details.
11. Copy and Paste the code from CREATE_SEQUENCE_EMPID.txt to your SQL Developer and run it by following instruction no. 3.
12. Once done creating the sequence, Open the text file named: PROCEDURE_ADD_EMPLOYEE.txt.
13. Copy and Paste the code from PROCEDURE_ADD_EMPLOYEE.txt to your SQL Developer and run it by following instruction no. 3.
14. Once done with the compilation, run the script below if you want to add new employee detail:
    e.g. EXEC ADD_EMPLOYEE('MARIA FATIMA', 2500, 100);
    Note: The value 'MARIA FATIMA' is the employee name, 2500 is the Salary and 100 is the unique department id.
15. To check for your employee's salary, Open the text file named: FUNCTION_GET_SALARY.txt.
16. Copy and Paste the code from FUNCTION_GET_SALARY.txt to your SQL Developer and run it by following instruction no. 3.
17. You only need the Employee Id. To run the function, run the script below:
    e.g. SELECT get_salary(1002)
         FROM dual;
    Note: 1002 is an example of Employee ID generated by the Sequence you compiled earlier.
18. By updating the salary of your employee, OPEN the text file PROCEDURE_UPDATE_SALARY.txt.
19. Copy and Paste the code from PROCEDURE_UPDATE_SALARY.txt to your SQL Developer and run it by following instruction no. 3.
20. Run the script below to update your employee's salary:
    e.g. EXEC UPDATE_SALARY(1002, 12500);
    Note: 1002 is an example of Employee ID generated by the Sequence you compiled earlier.
          12500 is the NEW salary of the employee.
21. By getting the employees with high salary according to the specified threshold, Open the text file PROCEDURE_HIGH_SALARY.txt.
22. Copy and Paste the code from PROCEDURE_HIGH_SALARY.txt to your SQL Developer and run it by following instruction no. 3.
23. Run the script below to display the details of the employees who have high salary based on the threshold:
    e.g. EXEC HIGH_SALARY(10000);
    Note: The value 10000 is the threshold amount. Anything greater than the threshold will be displayed.
